## ToDo List Application
   This application is a simple ToDo list manager built using React. It allows users to add tasks with titles and descriptions, mark tasks as completed, and view completed tasks. The application's styling has been customized using CSS. Below is an overview of its functionality and the integrated styling:
### Features
    Add New ToDo Item:
    Users can input a title and description for a new task and click the "Add" button to add it to the list.
    
    Complete ToDo:
    By clicking the checkmark icon (âœ“) next to a ToDo item, users can mark the task as completed. The item will be moved to the Completed section, displaying the completion timestamp.
    
    Delete ToDo:
    Users can delete an active ToDo item by clicking the trash icon (ðŸ—‘).
    
    Switch Views:
    Users can switch between the active ToDo list and the Completed list by clicking the "To Do" and "Completed!" buttons.

### Styling
    The application features a custom styling using CSS to create an appealing and functional user interface. Here are some of the styling details:
    
    The application has a dark background color with light gray text for improved readability.
    The ToDo list is contained within a wrapper with a scrollable content area and a maximum height of 80vh.
    Input fields have a distinct appearance with a border-bottom and padding.
    Buttons have distinct styles for the primary and secondary actions, changing color on hover.

For a detailed breakdown of the styling classes and their descriptions, please refer to the CSS code provided earlier.
